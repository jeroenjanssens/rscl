`rush` is an R package that allows you to run expressions, create plots, and install packages directly from the shell.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `rush` with:

```r
remotes::install_github("jeroenjanssens/rush")
```

## Examples

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir="exec")
```

`rush` should be invoked from the command line. The executable is located in the *exec* sub-directory of the package directory.

```{bash}
./rush run 6*7
```

Read from standard input:

```{bash}
seq 6 | ./rush run -H '2 * sum(df$x1)' -
```

Write to standard output:

```{bash}
./rush run 'head(mtcars, 10)' | tee mtcars.csv
```

Show generated script with the `--dry-run` option:

```{bash}
< mtcars.csv ./rush qplot --dry-run --x mpg --geom density --fill 'factor(cyl)'
```

Create plots with the `qplot command`:

```{bash}
< mtcars.csv ./rush qplot --x mpg --geom density --fill 'factor(cyl)' > ../man/figures/mtcars.png 
```
